## The Game

In DuctTape Dungeon, you play as either Georgios or Julian (similarity in name or sprite to any real person being pure coincidences) as you fight agains monsters to save one another! 
Travel trough a proceduraly generated dungeon using proceduraly generated guns to shoot proceduraly generated projectiles to fight proceduraly generated enemies while listening to proceduraly generated music! (All bugs and glitches are intended and part of the experience, no matter how disruptive.)

## The Absurd Amount of Duct Taped AI Systems

- PCG generation of levels using celular automata
- PCG generation of guns using Dall-e mini
- PCG generation of tiles using Perlin noise
- PCG generation of projectiles using probability theory
- PCG generation of music using applied theoretical knowledge
- PCG generation of sound effects using good ol'randomness
- PCG story generation
- PCG gun naming 
- RL agent trained to solve the game
- Use of Graph theory to check the validity of each map
- Use of AI algorithms for the behaviour of the enemies
- Prediction of player emotion based on level (under construction)
- No quality control
